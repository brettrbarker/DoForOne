## Do For One: What You Wish You Could Do for Everyone

There are times when we see a need and we really want to help, but we become paralyzed when we feel like our contribution is just too small. Or, we think it isn’t fair to help just one when there are so many in need. We don’t think we can really make a difference, and we can’t stand the thought of leaving someone out. But what if we **COULD** make a difference? What if our thought process was flawed and our contribution really did matter? What if we each chose to **do for one what we wish we could do for everyone?**  

We know we can’t help everyone. There are so many needs and so many people to help, but at **Do For One**, we have decided to help where we can.  

## Our Current Focus  

Right now, our focus is on providing an education to the kids at **Casa Hogar Elim orphanage** in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. That’s **60 kids** we can help break out of the cycle of poverty—with your help. Would you consider doing for one of these kids what we wish we could do for everyone?  

## The Need  

The kids at Casa Hogar Elim have diverse backgrounds, but they all have one thing in common—**poverty.** The leaders who run CHE do an amazing job of providing a loving, caring environment for these kids. They provide for their basic physical, spiritual, and emotional needs. But to truly break out of poverty, these kids need something else—**opportunity.** And the best way to give them an opportunity to be self-sufficient is to help them stay in school.  

Currently, it costs about **$150 per year (USD)** for the elementary kids to go to school. Middle school is a little more expensive, and high school can cost up to **$800 per year** for tuition, books, uniforms, and other supplies. Some of these kids also go on to university to earn a degree in areas such as International Business and Nursing. The cost for university is only about **$1,200 per year**, and it can make such an amazing difference in their future!  

## How You Can Help  

We currently do not have a way for you to sponsor a specific child to go to school. However, if you would like to use the above cost estimates to help one of these kids go to school this next year, you can give whatever amount works for you. You can give a **one-time gift** or a **recurring monthly donation.**  

**Do For One** is a **501(c)(3) non-profit organization**, and all donations are tax-exempt. **100%** of your donations go directly to meet the needs of the kids at Casa Hogar Elim.
