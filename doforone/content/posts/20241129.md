Thank you to those of you who went on a trip with us to Casa Hogar Elim, gave financial support, or otherwise expressed interest in the kids at CHE in the past. A few years ago I changed jobs/careers and it became difficult for me to keep everyone connected to CHE as I had to reduce my time there as well. However, I hope to change that now, so keep reading for a quick update!

Do4One.org is the non-profit we started a long time ago to fund our work primarily at CHE and mostly to fund the educational expenses of the kids. At that time, the kids were not able to stay in school past middle school because it was too expensive. We have been covering their tuition and other costs ever since. There have even been numerous kids to complete their degree at the local university. Oddly, college isn't much more expensive than university there. We are still taking care of these expenses and still raising funds to do so. If you would like to support one of these kids, there will be a link to a new [giving platform](/give) on our new website soon. We'll send out another email when it's available.

The past few years have been tough at CHE. Covid was difficult in Nuevo Laredo and at CHE specifically. All school moved online, but the public schools did not provide materials for this. The kids got behind and struggled. Luckily, there were some volunteers at CHE to keep them doing their work as much as possible, and they are all now back to in person learning.

Papa, Mama Lupita's husband, also passed away due to Covid which was very difficult on everyone. Additionally, Gladys, who many of you remember as the very special non-verbal girl who always had the huge smile, passed away during this time as well.

There are currently around 65 kids at CHE. This has been a consistent number over the past few years, but it is down from the 100+ of years past.

Overall, everyone is doing well and they would always love a visit from you! I have not put a trip together in a while due to my work schedule, but if you are interested in visiting the kids just let me know, and we'll get something arranged.

Thanks again for your continued interest in these kids. If you would like to get occasional updates and pictures, I'll post them sporadically when there is something to share, or you can [subscribe to emails](/contact). Feel free to reach out at anytime with questions.

I hope you had a great Thanksgiving! We all have so much to be thankful for, and I'm very thankful for you!

-Shaun
